# Types of Machine Learning

## 1. Supervised Learning
**Definition**: In supervised learning, the model is trained on a labeled dataset, which means that each training example is paired with an output label. The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs.

**Applications**:
- Image classification
- Spam detection
- Speech recognition
- Predictive maintenance

## 2. Unsupervised Learning
**Definition**: In unsupervised learning, the model is trained on data that does not have labeled responses. The system tries to learn the patterns and the structure from the input data.

**Applications**:
- Customer segmentation
- Anomaly detection
- Market basket analysis
- Topic modeling

## 3. Semi-supervised Learning
**Definition**: Semi-supervised learning is a middle ground between supervised and unsupervised learning. It uses a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data to improve learning accuracy.

**Applications**:
- Text classification
- Web content classification
- Medical image classification
- Speech analysis

## 4. Reinforcement Learning
**Definition**: In reinforcement learning, an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize some notion of cumulative reward. The agent learns from the consequences of its actions, rather than from being told explicitly what to do.

**Applications**:
- Robotics
- Game AI
- Autonomous vehicles
- Personalized recommendations
